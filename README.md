# PantryPal 

### Project Description
PantryPal is a high-performance, privacy-focused kitchen management web application designed to reduce food waste and simplify meal planning. Built with a robust **Go** backend and a type-safe **TypeScript** frontend, the platform allows users to track inventory, monitor expiration dates through real-time notifications, and manage household supplies across multiple users. 

By leveraging a monorepo architecture, PantryPal demonstrates modern software engineering principles including concurrent background workers for expiry checks, role-based access control, and a responsive, mobile-first user interface.

### Tech Stack
